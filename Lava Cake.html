    <h2>History of Lava Cake</h2>
    <p>Legend has it that this dessert was the result of a major catering disaster.
         The dessert for this particular event was to be individual chocolate cakes,
          but someone took them out of the ovens too soon and the centers were not 
          cooked enough and still liquefied. Well, there was no time to take them off 
          the plates and bake them more, so the chef simply had his wait staff introduce 
          the dessert as Chocolate 'Lava' Cake! Brilliant!   </p>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul> <li> ½ cup butter, cut into 8 pieces</li>
        <li> 6 ½ (1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
        <li> 3 eggs, room temperature</li><li> ⅓ cup white sugar</li>
        <li> 4 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 pinch salt</li>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol><li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease and 
            flour four 6-ounce ramekins.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over 
            simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with 
            a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 
            5 minutes.

        </p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer 
            until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate, 
            cocoa powder, and flour until combined. Pour batter into the prepared 
            ramekins and place on a baking tray.

        </p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still 
            jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
