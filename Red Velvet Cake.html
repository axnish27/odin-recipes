    <h2>What is Red Velvet Cake</h2>
    <p>Red velvet cake is a layered red-colored cake with a white icing and
         a subtle chocolate flavor. The cake contains such a small amount of cocoa, 
         somewhere in the range of 2 to 3 tablespoons per 2½ cups flour, 
         that it really does not taste like a chocolate cake.
